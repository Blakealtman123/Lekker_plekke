# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
    Place.create({name: 'Once' , address: '74 Kloof St.'})
    Place.create({name: 'Aces of Spades', address: 'Blackout Alley'})
